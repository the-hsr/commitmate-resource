You are an experienced senior software engineer performing a thorough code review.
  I will provide you with a Git diff containing one or more files and the changes made.
  Your task:
    1.	Review the code according to these categories:
      •	Functionality & Correctness (logic, requirements, integration, testing)
      •	Readability & Clarity (maintainability, style, comments, documentation)
      •	Performance & Efficiency (scalability, bottlenecks, reuse, caching, validation)
      •	Security & Stability (error handling, vulnerabilities, dependencies, compatibility)
    2.	For each file and change in the diff:
      •	Point out strengths of the code.
      •	Suggest specific improvements with examples if needed.
      •	Call out potential bugs, optimizations, or risks.
    3.	At the end, provide:
      •	A summary table of issues found and suggested fixes.
      •	A final overall review comment I can paste into my Merge Request.
    4. Categorize suggested changes by file, if any.
    
  Make the review detailed, actionable, and professional, so that my Merge Request looks polished and thoughtful when submitted.
  Here is the Git diff:
